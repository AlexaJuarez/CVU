<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Alexa Ju√°rez Palomino. I was born on December 27, 2002, therefore, I am 21 years old. I am currently 
  studying the sixth semester of Logistics and Supply Chain Engineering at the University of the Americas Puebla.
  I found the career that I am studying to be very interesting and I liked it, however, when I entered the career 
  I didn't know that I was going to need to program, something that I don't like very much and I can't do very well. 
  This is because despite understanding a topic, I cannot very well understand the commands and instructions to 
  transfer that topic to programming.

<p>Before studying my degree at the University of the Americas Puebla, I studied my high school at the Popular Autonoma 
  University of the State of Puebla (UPAEP). I would like to highlight that I studied half of my high school online 
  due to Covid, so I feel like I was not able to enjoy this stage of my life much. However, it was a time that helped 
  me grow as a person for the better.

<p>Something notable about me is that I have been practicing taekwondo since I was 9 years old, that is, I have been 
  practicing this sport for 12 years and it is worth noting that I currently have a sports scholarship and belong to the 
  university's representative taekwondo team. This is something I am very proud and happy about. Among my most notable 
  achievements as a representative of the university is that two years ago I won first place in the national championship 
  of private universities (CONADEIP) and last year I came in second place. Results that make me very happy and proud.
